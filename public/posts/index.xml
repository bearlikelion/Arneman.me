      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Mark! I have been wanting to redo my personal portfolio website for a while, so I finally got around to doing so! I played around with a few static site generators but ultimately landed on the Go powered Hugo. I wanted something easy to develop in as well as create content.&#xA;Thank you for stopping by,&#xA;-Mark</description>

      <title>Resolving Local DNS in Pi-Hole</title>

      <description>I love Pi-hole, it’s a network based ad blocker that reports all DNS Queries.&#xA;But, I’ve been having an issue resolving host names on my local domain through the Pi-hole.&#xA;I run an Active Directory/DNS server with all my entries, Pi-hole is the first DNS Provider on my network, and I can resolve the host names on Pi-hole fine. But when I resolve them through the Pi-hole I get no response.</description>

      <description>While it might be convenient to RDP to your Hyper-V host and use the manager on the server directly. I prefer to run the manage multiple hosts all from my local machine. Below are the steps to take to install the Hyper-V management tools, enable credential delegation, and connect to your host from your local machine. Install the Hyper-V Management Tools&#xA;From Add/Remove Programs, select &amp;lsquo;Turn Windows features on or off&amp;rsquo;, then check the Hyper-V Management Tools Once installed, you will have the Hyper-V Manager under &amp;lsquo;Windows Administrator Tools&amp;rsquo; in your Start menu</description>
