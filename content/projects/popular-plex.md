This script is designed to run weekly, generating collections in Plex of most popular Movies and Television based on the data from the Tautulli API. It uses the [python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi) package and [requests](http://python-requests.org/).

The idea behind this project was to recreate Netflix's 'What's Popular' list
