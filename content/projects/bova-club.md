# bova.club

Bova Club was a prank website I designed for my friend Dave Bova. While watching Dave's place during a vacation I set his Google Chrome homepage to the URL [bova.club](https://bova.club/).

This updated all of his devices to use the new homepage and *somehow* it kept reapplying itself.
